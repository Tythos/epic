to leverage a dependency, we:
* resolve the location of the package
* build the package if necessary
* include the package directory for Include headers
* link against the package static library

a system set of epic packages is located in EPIC_REPO
each package folder has a build_graph.csv and a package.json
the package.json indicates the UNI, semver, and dependencies
dependencies are defined as UNIs and semver constraints

to resolve a dependency location
* EPIC_REPO subfolders are searched
* package.json contents are checked for matching UNIs and semvers
* the location of the most recent matching package is returned
