epic package dependencies:
 * cite git URL
 * check out to local package repository
 * verify semver constraint (TODO)
 * include package path
 * build library for configuration
 * link against library

e.g., if local package repository EPIC_REPO=C:\Projects, for dependency glew:
{ "dependencies": { "gitlab.corp.exoanalytic.com:sdl/glew": ">= 2.0" } }
 * checked out to C:\Projects\com.exoanalytic.corp.gitlab.sdl.glew\2.1.0
 * include flag (MSVC: /I) to that path [glew]
 * library built to / link against from [glew]/lib/[arch]/[cfg]/glew.lib?
 * static only, or support .dll too?
